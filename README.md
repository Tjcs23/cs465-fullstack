CS-465 full stack development with MEAN

Architecture and Functionality
The frontend development employed a combination of Express HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic web pages with interactive elements. Additionally, the integration of Angular facilitated the construction of a single-page application (SPA), enabling a seamless and intuitive user experience without the need for constant page reloads. On the backend, the utilization of the MongoDB database provided a flexible and scalable data storage solution, effectively managing the data structures of the application.

Testing and Reflection
In terms of testing, API testing was conducted to ensure the reliability of the application's endpoints. The evaluation of security measures played a crucial role, emphasizing the importance of ensuring a secure environment for all users. Throughout the development process, various elements of the application were refactored to enhance functionality and efficiency, contributing to a more streamlined and effective project. I had some problems with the authentication part of this project, but with further learning and practice I believe I will be able to remedy this. This project has significantly enriched my understanding of the MEAN stack, providing valuable insights into the intricacies of full stack web development and solidifying my skill set for future projects in this field.
